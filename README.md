## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Encrypt Files**: Upload files, generate encryption keys, and securely store them.  
2. **Store on IPFS**: Files are uploaded to the decentralized IPFS network to ensure integrity.  
3. **Key Management**: Encryption keys are converted into images for easy storage and retrieval.  
4. **NFT Ownership**: Optionally mint NFTs linked to encrypted file metadata for ownership tracking.  
5. **Decryption**: Seamlessly retrieve and decrypt files using stored keys.
